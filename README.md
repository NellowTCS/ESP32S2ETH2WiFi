This project aims to create a versatile and efficient communication bridge that enables seamless connectivity between Ethernet and Wi-Fi networks using the LOLIN S2 Mini microcontroller and the USR-ES1 Ethernet module. It leverages the capabilities of the LOLIN S2 Mini to support dual networking, allowing users to effectively forward data packets between Ethernet and Wi-Fi connections.

## Objectives:
- Seamless Data Forwarding:
  Facilitate forwarding TCP and UDP traffic between Wi-Fi and Ethernet networks, ensuring uninterrupted communication for IoT applications.
- Wi-Fi Connectivity:
  Allow users to connect to a Wi-Fi network by providing their SSID and password through a web interface.
- User Interface: Implement a simple web-based interface that enables users to manage connections and send commands to the LOLIN S2 Mini.
